# Outer Wilds Save Editor

A simple mod that allows you to edit your save file.

## How To Use

Once installed, "EDIT SAVE DATA" will appear on the title screen and pause menu, pressing it will open a menu that allows you to edit various aspects of your data.

## Options

- Time loop started: Whether the time loop has begun (you need to relaunch the game after saving if you edit this)
- Learned Launch Codes: Whether you have the launch codes for the ship
- Earn All Achievements: Earns every achievement in the game if your platform supports it
- Met Solanum: Whether you've encountered solanum in a previous loop
- Met Prisoner: Whether you've met the prisoner in a previous loop
- Warped To The Eye Of The Universe: Whether you've gotten to the eye of the universe (this also requires a relaunch of the game, otherwise say goodbye to your ears)
- Signals & Frequencies: Allows you to learn or forget all signals and frequencies
- Ship Log: Allows you to learn or forget all ship log entries (You can only do this while in the Solar System or at the Eye Of The Universe)
